            <h2>Our Process</h2>
            <p>We start by looking at the layout of your home. If their is anything that 
                needs to be moved or covered we first make sure there is nothing we can 
                damage incase shingle goes flying the wrong way. Next we find the best place
                to park our dump truck without making streeks on your pavmerent or the grass.
                If this is not posible we simply park it on your drive way and carry the old shingles to the truck.
                Once we know everthing is protected we start tearing the old shinglles off and the felt underneath.
                Next we look for any rooten wood to replace. Once everthing looks good we
                put the new felt and shingles on. Laslt we look over the roof to make sure nothing 
                looks out of place and clean evething up like we where never there.
            </p>
